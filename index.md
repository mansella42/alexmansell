# Introduction

Welcome! You may have read accounts from your grandparents' archived Facebook accounts or browsed through old, 2-dimensional photos of a bygone era where people once gathered together for things known simply as **parties**.

I know, ridiculous isn't it? Humans crowded in a small space? Sounds like a recipe for biological disaster. However, with the impending 30 year gathering restrctions being lifted, we're here to introduce to you what a party is, in case you feel the urge to see humans in the flesh for the first time.

> **NOTE:**  To help alleviate your party anxiety, we explain:

> * [core party components](#core-party-components)
> * [general tips on enjoying the party](#the-party-and-you)

# What is a party?

You have likely Googled `what is a party` or `party definition` and found something along the lines of the following:

> party: a gathering where people come together to drink, dance, and socialise; often involving an invitation with the typical objective to celebrate an event

A party is much more than that. The physical coming-together of people is also rife with energy, chemistry, and feelings that arise only through physical contact and the presence of another person. Ideas often pass more quickly and [intuition](https://www.google.com/search?q=intuition&oq=intuition&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j46j0j69i65.692j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8){:target="_blank"} enables you to garner the feeling of mind-reading. Memories are made. This occurs not just through audible commentary and conversation, but through shared glances, a slight touch of hand, a funny moment when a friend trips over the game board (a physical one - not just an app).

So yes, a party is physical gathering of people who often drink, sing, dance, reminisce, laugh, hug, and smile. However, the feeling that resonates through the shared energy of being among your own species is an almost indescribable experience. 

> **TIP:** To help you navigate this experience, continue to the next section to understand the [core party components](#core-party-components).

# The party and you

To fully understand something, you need to have context. As someone deprived of physical contact with *traditional friends*, the idea of a party can seem daunting. However, remember that you have a natural yearning to connect and though your connections have been via a digital platform for so long, nurture those interests you have and soon enough, you will find yourself "partying" with people and living life as it was meant to be lived. Enjoy!
